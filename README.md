> *"Another day, another personal project nobody asked me for."* 😌

Welcome to **Lumière** — a ✨ personal Flutter app ✨ I built to escape tutorial hell and touch some real code for once.  
It's a movie browsing app with smooth vibes, spicy gradients, and just enough Firebase to feel something.

I made this to practice Flutter, play with clean UI, and pretend I work at Netflix for a bit. You're welcome.

## Features

- 📽️ **Browse movies** – Scroll through trending and popular stuff like a real critic
- 🔍 **Search** – Type things, find things. Revolutionary.
- 🎭 **Details page** – See the cast, crew, plot. Act like you're gonna watch it.
- 🔐 **Login & Signup** – Because even fake apps need authentication
- 📱 **Responsive design** – Runs on Android, iOS, and probably your smart fridge

## How to Run It (aka You Wanna See It Move)

### What You’ll Need:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK
- VS Code or Android Studio (or vim if you like pain)

### Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pain4pple/Lumiere.git
cd Lumiere/movie_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
Boom. It works. Probably.

## Project Structure (Don't Worry It's Organized-ish)
For this project, I followed the MDD architecture. Therefore, there is the classic data, domain, and presentation layer for each feature.
```
lib/
├── features/         # Stuff like auth, movie_details, movie_list, video player, etc.
├── core/             # Shared logic so I don’t go insane duplicating code
├── config/           # Routes, themes, constants
assets/               # Fonts, images, etc.
```

## 🤝 Contributing?
It's a personal project, but if you wanna vibe, break stuff, or flex your skills, send in a PR.
Worst case? I ignore it. Best case? We ship Lumiere 2: Electric Boogaloo.
